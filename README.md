# Project Groot ðŸŒ±

Project Groot is an open-source garden management system. In its core, Project Groot is aregular automatic plant growing system: it reads data from humidity and light sensors anddecides when to give the plants more water, less water, more light or less light. Whatdifferentiates Project Groot from other garden management systems, is that it allows users towrite their own growth plans for different plants. Users can then share their growth plans throughthe Groot network and users can also download and review plans from other users. Project Grootcan also manage various plants with different sensors and growth plans at the same time.
